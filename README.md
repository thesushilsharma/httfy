# httfy 📣  
> _HTTP + Notify. Short. Catchy. Powerful._

**httfy** is a lightweight, HTTP-based **publish-subscribe notification service** that lets you send and receive real-time push notifications — from any script, app, or service — using nothing but an HTTP request.

Think of it like `curl` for notifications.

Whether you're debugging a script, monitoring a server, or building a home automation system, **httfy makes it easy to get alerts where you need them** — instantly.
